The monolith is massive, easily as tall as a skyscraper, and completely smooth and featureless. You and your crew can't see any doors, windows, or any other indication of what might lie inside. It's as if the structure was carved from a single piece of stone. As they begin to explore, you and your crew realize that the black sand that surrounds the monolith is more than just a simple desert. The sand is almost magnetic, clinging to any metal objects and causing the crew's compass to spin wildly. It's as if the very fabric of reality has been warped by the presence of the monolith.
